# Week 0 – Scratch Project: Solar System Animation

This project is a simple animation created using Scratch for Week 0 of Harvard's CS50x course.

## 🌞 Project Overview

In this animation, the user learns a fun fact about the Sun while watching a basic visualization of the Earth, Sun, and a rocket. It's an introductory project designed to demonstrate key programming concepts in a creative and visual way.

### 🧠 What You’ll See
- A starry backdrop with Earth and a rocket in orbit.
- A scripted fact about the Sun delivered through a sprite.
- Motion, dialogue, and timing to enhance the presentation.

## 🧱 Concepts Used
- **Events**: Project begins with a green flag click.
- **Sequencing**: Sprite actions occur in a specific order.
- **Looks**: Sprite uses "say" blocks to display the Sun fact.
- **Motion**: Basic movement to show animation effects.

## 🔗 Project File
- `[project.sb3](https://submit.cs50.io/users/mtnuss/cs50/problems/2025/x/scratch)`: [Download or run in Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)  
(You can upload this file on the Scratch site or view it using the Scratch offline editor.)

## 💬 Sun Fact
> The Sun was formed in a stellar nursery or nebula. This is an area of high-density gas where, with the right conditions, the gas can get so dense fusion can begin.
